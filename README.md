Step 1: Create a Registration Form Component

- Choose a Location: Navigate to the directory
within your project where your other React
components are located.
- Create a New File: In this chosen directory,
create a new JavaScript file. You can name it
something like RegistrationForm.js.
- Import React and Required Dependencies: Inside
the RegistrationForm.js file, begin by importing
React and any necessary React hooks or components. 
- Define the RegistrationForm Function: Create a
JavaScript function named RegistrationForm that
will serve as the core of your Registration
Form Component.
- Set Up State Variables: Within the RegistrationForm
function, set up state variables using React's
useState hook.

Step 2: Add handlers, buttons and return statement

- Handle Form Field Changes: Implement a function,
such as handleChange, to handle changes in form fields.
- Handle Form Submission: Create a function,
like handleSubmit, that will handle the form
submission when the user attempts to register.
- Build the Form Structure: Construct the structure
of your registration form using HTML and JSX.
Include form elements like text inputs for
username, email, and password.
- Add Buttons: Include buttons in the form for
actions like "Register" and "Close." 

Step 3: Add Registration Button to Nav Menu

- In your App.js file, import the RegistrationForm 
component at the top of the file.
- Inside the App component, add a state variable to
control the visibility of the registration form.
- Create a function to toggle the visibility of
the registration form.
- Add a button in the nav menu that will trigger
the registration form.

Step 4: Styling for Small Screens

- In your CSS file, make adjustments to the styling
for small screens using the @media query. 

Step 5: Toggle Registration Form

- Back in App.js, conditionally render the RegistrationForm
based on the isRegistrationVisible state.

Step 6: Close Button in Registration Form

- In the RegistrationForm.js component, add a close 
button and an onClick handler to hide the registration form.
Create the handleCloseClick function
